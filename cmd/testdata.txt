Now let's review the patch carefully. I'll focus on important improvements and potential issues.

```yaml
- file: satellite/nodeselection/stream.go
  line: 40
  comment: The comment for StreamFilter has a typo - "enouh" should be "enough"

- file: satellite/nodeselection/stream.go
  line: 114
  comment: The containsID and containsNode functions duplicate checks that are already done in the stream function. Consider moving these checks to a single place to avoid redundancy.

- file: satellite/nodeselection/stream.go
  line: 76
  comment: In the Stream selector, the filtered nodes slice is recreated even though the filter is already applied later in the NodeStream. This creates unnecessary allocations.

- file: satellite/nodeselection/stream.go
  line: 156
  comment: In ChoiceOfNStream, if no nodes are available, it returns nil. Consider adding an error message similar to the Stream function to provide better debugging information.

- file: satellite/nodeselection/config.go
  line: 326
  comment: The choiceofns function uses panic() for error handling, which is inconsistent with the rest of the codebase that returns errors. Consider changing to return an error instead.

- file: satellite/nodeselection/stream_test.go
  line: 15
  comment: TestGroupConstraint has unnecessary whitespace at the beginning of the function that should be removed for consistency.

- file: satellite/nodeselection/stream_test.go
  line: 206
  comment: TestChoiceOfNStream uses a fixed score function based on node ID, which might make the test brittle if node IDs change. Consider using a more robust scoring approach.
